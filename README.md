My Vite-based React Project
This is a basic template for a Vite-based React resume website. It provides a quick setup for modern web development with React, leveraging Vite's fast development server and optimized build process.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up and run the project locally.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm) installed on your system.

Node.js: Download & Install Node.js (includes npm)

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name

Replace your-username/your-repository-name.git with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

Install dependencies:
Use your preferred package manager:

npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install

Running the Development Server
To start the development server and begin coding, run:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

The application will typically be available at http://localhost:5173/ (or another port if 5173 is in use). Vite will automatically open it in your browser.

Build for Production
When you're ready to deploy your application, you can create an optimized production build:

npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build

This command will compile your React application and place the optimized static assets in the ./dist directory. This dist folder is what you would deploy to a static hosting service.

Previewing the Production Build
You can preview the production build locally before deployment:

npm run preview
# or
yarn preview
# or
pnpm preview

This will serve the static files from the dist directory, allowing you to test how your production build behaves. It typically runs on http://localhost:4173/.

Happy Hacking!
